-I need to develop a welcome page that has instructions, a button to start the quiz, and has style that contains my content

-When the quiz starts a header needs to appear that has the timer in it, and the high scores can be accessed as well

-each time they answer a question the submit button takes them to the next question

-if they also answered hte qyuestion incorrectly then time is removed from the timer

-the quiz is over if the user answers all the questions or if the timer hits zero.

-when the quiz is over, the user will be prompted to ener their initials to save their highscore

-if the user does not qualify for a high score then the user will not be prompted to enter anything. Instead the will be taken to a page that encourages them to study and retake the quiz
