# JSQuiz

This is a quiz application ran in the browser. The quiz was developed to test the users knowledge of JavaScript, as well as my own understanding of the language. 

The quiz starts with a home/instructions page. The user is prompted with a dynamic button. 

The quiz starts and the score as well as the users progress is displayed at the top of the quiz. 

The user is shown a form where they are able to select one answer. (I did not enter in the timer yet)

They may submit their answer, and see their progress as they go. (if the user were to get the wrong answer the timer would dcrease in time)

I ran into a problem in my code that I could not figure out the solution to. On lines 69-75 I wrote an if else statement to return the users answer in order to update the score, progression, and eventually the timer and high score elements. However no matter what I did to pull the users answer and equate it to the correct answer I always got an error or I got a user answer of null.

This problem persisted, and without a solution for this problem I couldn't progress to make the rest of the application. I will most likely continue to work to resolve this error, and hopefully be able to resubmit, if allowed.
